## Welcome to Your Business Command Center

OlympusAI transforms how you manage your business by providing AI-powered insights and actionable recommendations. This guide will help you navigate the platform and maximize your results from day one.

## Understanding Your Dashboard

Your Dashboard is the heart of OlympusAI - it's where AI tells you exactly what to do next.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Navigate to [app.etho.net](https://app.etho.net/) and log into your account. The Dashboard is your default landing page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Olympus Actions">
    Start with the **Olympus Actions** section - these are AI-powered recommendations prioritized by urgency and impact:
    
    - **Critical Alerts** (Red): Handle these first - they could cost you money
    - **Growth Opportunities** (Green): Scale what's working for maximum impact  
    - **Optimization Suggestions** (Yellow): Improve underperforming elements
    - **Admin Tasks** (Blue): System maintenance and tracking fixes
    - **Creative Opportunities** (Pink): Content and engagement opportunities
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Incomplete Actions">
    Review tasks that need your attention in the **Incomplete Actions** section. These are prioritized by importance and time pending.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Use **Revenue Analytics** and **Growth Metrics** to track your business performance across different time periods (24H, 7D, 30D, All).
  </Step>
